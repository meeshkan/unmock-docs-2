## What is Unmock

Unmock is a JavaScript testing library that allows you to write comprehensive tests for third-party API integrations.

Inspired by libraries like [`nock`](https://github.com/nock/nock) and [`hoverfly`](https://github.com/spectolabs/hoverfly), Unmock aims to simplify the API testing process by creating a small, isolated, ephemeral stack for every test that makes an API call.
